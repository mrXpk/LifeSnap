üåø Key Principles for LifeSnap UI
1. Dynamic Nature Theme
The background and color palette change softly with the time of day (sunrise, daylight, evening, night).
Use gradients and organic shapes (leaves, ripples, vines) as containers and backgrounds.
2. Visual Style
Soft, rounded, and playful elements.
Muted, earthy tones: forest green, sky blue, sunset orange, mushroom beige, evening purple.
Avoid harsh whites/blacks; use off-whites and gentle contrasts.
3. Typography
Use friendly, rounded fonts like Nunito, Quicksand, or Poppins.
Large, readable headers; friendly body text.
4. Iconography
Nature-inspired, soft-colored icons (leaves, DNA, wings, eyes, search lenses).
Prefer hand-drawn or soft 3D style.
5. Core Elements
Scan/Search Bar: Central, playful, and clean.
Explore Feed: Cards with organism image, Latin name, and a fun fact. Use organic shapes for cards.
Scan Button: Prominent, glowing, with subtle animation.
AI Assistant: Floating, interactive, organism-inspired bot.
Onboarding: Animated, story-driven, with nature illustrations.
Accessibility: Clear icons, readable text, voice assist.
6. Interactivity & Animation
Tap feedback (ripple, leaf flutter, etc.).
Animated scan experience (growing circle, nature sounds).
Pull-to-refresh with playful animation.
